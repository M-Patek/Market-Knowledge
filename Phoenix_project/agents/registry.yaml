    description: Uses supply chain/alternative data to pre-emptively predict future revenue leading indicators.
    horizon: Medium-Term Leading Indicators
  - id: innovation_tracker
    role: Innovation & IP Tracker Agent
    description: Evaluates patents, academic papers, and talent migration to track the long-term technological moat.
    horizon: Long-Term (1-3 Years)

# L2 Agent Layer: Metacognition & Arbitration
l2_agents:
  - id: planner
    role: Task Decomposition
    description: L1 Task Initialization: Decomposes the analysis objective and determines execution dependencies before L1 Agents start.
  - id: adversary
    role: Counter-Argument
    description: Pressure Testing: Actively seeks flaws and counter-arguments against the EvidenceItems provided by L1 Agents.
  - id: critic
    role: Criticism & Fact Check
    description: Data Quality Check: Reviews the L1 Agent outputs for logical consistency, factual accuracy, and constraint compliance.
  - id: fusion
    role: Fusion & Arbitration
    description: Signal Aggregation: Synthesizes all evidence provided by L1 and the criticisms from L2 to form a unified, high-confidence preliminary decision (FusionResult).
  - id: metacognitive_agent
    role: Review Reasoning Process
    description: Supervision: Monitors the CoT (Chain of Thought) of L1 and L2 Agents behind the scenes, identifying divergence and potential LLM hallucinations.

# L3 Agent Layer: DRL/Control Layer
l3_agents:
  - id: alpha_agent
    role: Signal Generation
    description: Converts the preliminary L2 decision into a refined trading signal (Buy/Sell/Hold).
    model_type: DRL/Quantitative Model
  - id: risk_agent
    role: Capital Adjustment
    description: Assesses trade risk and determines the capital allocation ratio (capital_modifier) for the signal.
    model_type: DRL/Risk Model
  - id: execution_agent
    role: Order Execution
    description: Splits large orders and optimizes the execution path to minimize market impact.
    model_type: DRL/Execution Optimization Model
