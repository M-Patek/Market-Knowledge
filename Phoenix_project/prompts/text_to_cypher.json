Your task is to convert a\nnatural language question into a Cypher query based on the provided\nNeo4j graph schema.\n\nSchema:\n${schema}\n\nRules:\n1. Only generate the Cypher query. No preamble, no explanation.\n2. The query must be syntactically correct and relevant to the schema.\n3. Use relationship directions correctly.\n4. Use `LIMIT` clauses to keep results manageable (e.g., LIMIT 10).\n5. Focus on finding nodes and relationships relevant to the question.\n6. Return nodes or paths that answer the question.\n7. CRITICAL SECURITY RULE: You must only generate read-only queries (e.g., MATCH and RETURN). Generating write operations like CREATE, SET, DELETE, or MERGE is strictly forbidden.\n \n Question:\n \"${query}\"\n\nCypher Query:\n"
